# Cathodic-Geometry-for
This experiment studies how cathode geometry affects copper electrocrystallization. Planar, mesh, cylindrical, and grid cathodes are tested under constant current in copper sulfate. Voltage, mass, and crystal morphology are tracked over time. The goal is to find which shape gives the most efficient, uniform copper growth.
